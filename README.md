# OpenAI URL Summarizer

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


The OpenAI URL Summarizer is a tool that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate summaries of web pages. To use the URL Summarizer, you need to provide the URL of the web page you want to summarize. The URL Summarizer will then extract the text from the web page and use GPT-3 to generate a summary of the text.
